# Elpis

Elpis is a web platform that connects restaurants and individuals within a circular economy ecosystem. Its goal is to reduce food waste by allowing restaurants to sell surplus food at a lower price, while also creating micro-jobs for individuals in need by completing small community tasks.

- Food Marketplace: Restaurants can list their surplus food.
- Task Marketplace: Individuals can find and complete local tasks to earn income.
